# Ansible tooling for ACG Course, "Learn Docker by Doing"

* The idea is to build a tree of re-usable Ansible code, to implement the labs found in this course
* I know these may not be usable outside of the ACG infrastructure, which, for instance, has Python installed.
* The courses are based on CentOS7, so they're not going to last forever.
* But maybe we could build our own image... 
* Anyway, these are only samples so I can learn about using Ansible to automate configurations applied to Docker.
